# Heart_Disease_ML1
## Classification of Heart Disease using a variety of supervised learning classifiers

Authors: Rayhaan Rasheed, Solomon Mekonnen, Sam Aboagye

Date: 11/26/2018

### Data:
The data used in this project is the Heart Disease Dataset generated by Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D. at the V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The full database was pulled from the Machine Learning Repository created by the University of California Irvine.

There are 76 attributes in total, but the literature prefers using only 14 of them:

1. Age
2. Sex
3. Chest Pain Rating
4. Resting Blood Pressure
5. Serum Cholestoral in mg/dl
6. Blood Sugar Level While Fasting
7. Resting EKG
8. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
9. Exercise Induced Angina
10. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
11. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
12. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Flourosopy
13. HR Type (Normal, Fixed Defect, or Reversible Defect)
14. Class(target)

### Overview:
This project aims to evaluate and compare different classifers using the Heart Disease database. Instead on turning this into a multi-class classification problem, the target values will be changed to either 0 or 1. Any target value that has a value greater or equal to 1 will be a 1 in the new target column; likewise, anything with a 0 will stay 0. The reason for this is to focus on the fundamental issue of whether a patient qualifies for having any sign or heart disease (OnevsAll)

The classifiers used:
Logistic Regression,
Random Forest,
& Support Vector Machine
